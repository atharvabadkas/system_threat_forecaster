MODELS ARE GIVING ABOVE 0.55 IN THE SUBMISSION. TELL CURSOR TO TARGET 0.70 SO THAT YOU CAN GET 0.63-0.64 SOMETHING LIKE THAT


This is sample model I have created for my project. 

Overview of the project - 
The goal of this competition is to predict a systemâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that system. The telemetry data containing these properties and the system infections was generated by threat reports collected by system's antivirus software.

Evaluation - 
The evaluation section describes how submissions will be scored and how participants should format their submissions. Submissions are evaluated on accuracy_score() between the predicted classes and the True target.

Submission File - 
For each id in the test set, you must predict a class for the target variable. 

Dataset Description - 
Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a MachineID. target is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. Using the information and labels in train.csv, you must predict the value for target for each machine in test.csv

Files
train.csv - the training set
test.csv - the test set
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

Criteria to pass this project -
Students must attempt at least three different models to address the problem, as relying on a single model will not be acceptable. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the MLP project being disqualified.

Additionally, students are expected to:
Conduct thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to provide meaningful insights and support their modeling choices. The cut off score should be more than 0.60

Libraries allowed - 
Only the following libraries will be allowed to be used in the competition:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn 
XGBoost
Seaborn
Imblearn
SciPy
Pickle
regex
Lightgbm
Plotly

Please note these libraries are already installed in your Kaggle notebook. Python in-built libraries can also be used. Using libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, NLTK, word2vec, textblob etc is not allowed.

Following is the checklist for the project - 

1. The dataset is appropriately loaded and stored into corresponding variables.
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Visualizing key statistics and relationships in the data
4. Correctly identify the feature types.
5. Detecting missing data and imputation, if required.
6. The dataset is appropriately preprocessed,
scaling numerical features.
7. Encoding categorical features.
8. Appropriate usage of pipelines if any.
9. Feature engineering/extraction.
10. Hyperparameter tuning of the model to optimize its performance.
11. Code should be clean, well-structured, and appropriately commented.
12. Highlight important ideas learned from the dataset and/or model.
13. Compare at least 3 best models of all the models experimented, analyze their results, and provide insights on the model's performance.
14. Make submission with the model with the best score on training data.

Now based on all the information you have got. Do these things - 

1. Make 3 python files
2. Give me 3 models in the file (name the files according to the model)
3. Look at the code in the model.py file (We have to submit the file on kaggle so make the code according to that)
